## JGMaker Artist-D Unofficial and Experimental Firmware

This is my custom firmware that is built for the community of JGMaker Artist-D users. The changes in this firmware are made to the latest released version of Marlin. Released means it was tagged as a release in the upstream MarlinFirmware repository. 

The customizations to the firmware are pretty numerous. My goal is to enable as much functionality within Marlin to make the IDEX functionality of the Artist-D shine. This means experimental features in Marlin may be enabled. For example, this firmware supports the `G12` nozzle clean functionality. Also, advanced features and customizations have been made to tweak the functionality and user experience. The official firmware may keep advanced features and functions "hidden" so that the experience for novice users isn't overwhelming. For users looking at this repository it is highly likely they're moving beyond novice use of the printer and are striving for more and enhanced functionality.

All that said, this firmware is likely to have bugs or misconfigurations. Some of my personal machine settings may be in the configuration! Please take care to clear your EEPROM by intializing it and restoring your settings manually after each flash. It is a good habit to note what the `M503` command returns and use that to restore your settings after a flash.

**If the preceding paragraphs didn't emphasize this enough, you flash this firmware at your own risk. Neither I or JGMaker can be held responsible for you flashing an unsupported or unofficial firmware.**

### Enabled Features

* Babystepping
* Customized awesome bootscreen
* PID Auto tune
* Scroll long statuses and filenames
* Nozzle clean via `G12`
* Present the bed forward on aborted print
* Do not return tool to last position after tool change
* Wipe nozzle with `G12` after tool change

### Known Issues

* EEPROM saving doesn't work

## Customized Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
